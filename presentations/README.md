# Presentations

This is just an archive of the presentations I have given pertaining to this project.

## 2021-01-25 â€“ Haigis Lab Meeting

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-01-25_lab-meeting.key)

The second half of this presentation was a brief introduction into the kind of modeling that I will be using in this project.
The goal was to gently introduce the concept of hierarchical modeling.

## 2021-04-22 â€“ Park Lab Cancer Subgroup

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-04-22_cancer-subgroup-meeting.key)

Introduce the project to my colleagues in the Park Lab and present some preliminary results on mimicking the CERES model.

## 2021-05-03 â€“ Haigis Lab Meeting

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-05-03_lab-meeting.key)

An update on this project and the main challenges I have faced thus far.

## 2021-06-16 â€“ Park Lab Cancer Subgroup (journal club)

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-06-16_cancer-subgroup-meeting_journal-club.key)

I presented on the most relevant parts of the following two papers:

1. Pacini, Clare, Joshua M. Dempster, Isabella Boyle, Emanuel GonÃ§alves, Hanna Najgebauer, Emre Karakoc, Dieudonne van der Meer, et al. 2021. **"Integrated Cross-Study Datasets of Genetic Dependencies in Cancer."** Nature Communications 12 (1): 1661.
2. Dempster, Joshua M., Isabella Boyle, Francisca Vazquez, David Root, Jesse S. Boehm, William C. Hahn, Aviad Tsherniak, and James M. McFarland. 2021. **"Chronos: A CRISPR Cell Population Dynamics Model."** bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432728.

## 2021-08-30 â€“ Haigis Lab Meeting

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-08-30_lab-meeting.key)

Since there weren't many (any) biological results to present, I walked through the basics of the hierarchical modeling and the structure of this project as an example of how these large computational projects are organized.

## 2021-09-27 â€“ CRUK update

ðŸ“½ [Keynote](2021-09-27_cruk.key)

This was a brief overview of the project.
Some good references here for when it comes time to write the paper.
