# Notebooks

Notebooks were used for experimentation and analysis, not for modeling fitting â€“ model fitting was performed in a the modeling fitting pipeline.
Each subdirectory contains notebooks for a set of analyses.

Many of these notebooks can no longer be run from start to finish because the shared code has been altered and the notebook has not been updated.
This is not an issue for notebooks that are for experimentation or reference.
The expected behavior is indicated for each group of notebooks.
Note, the provided links are to the Markdown files generated from each notebook.

## [Data exploration](data-exploration)

![reproducibility-full](https://img.shields.io/badge/reproducibility-full-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

Notebooks for general exploratory data analysis.

1. [Basic data statistics and plots.](data-exploration/001_001_basic-data-statistics-and-plots.md)
1. [Exploration of molecular variates.](data-exploration/001_005_molecular-covariates-eda.md)
1. [Cell line lineages and lineage subtypes.](data-exploration/001_020_lineage-exploration.md) Understanding the lineage and lineage subtype relationships.
1. [Exploration of data by cell line lineage.](data-exploration/005_100_lineage-data-exploration.md) Testing how well the cell lines can be clustered by the raw log-fold change data.

## [Model design experimentation](model_design_experimentation)

![reproducibility-limited](https://img.shields.io/badge/reproducibility-limited-orange.svg?style=flat)

These notebooks are for experimenting with various model designs, each one using different covariates and model structures.
They primarily use synthetic data and test whether the known values can be recovered.

> These were early notebooks and are retained for reference only.

1. [Model 1.](model_design_experimentation/005_005_model-experimentation-m1.md) Standard linear model of one gene using RNA expression as a predictor.
1. [Model 2.](model_design_experimentation/005_007_model-experimentation-m2.md) A hierarchical linear model of multiple genes with a varying intercept and slope on RNA expression.
1. [Model 3.](model_design_experimentation/005_009_model-experimentation-m3.md) (Failed) A hierarchical model of multiple genes and cell lines with a varying intercept for each. The gene level model consisted of an intercept and slope for RNA expression.
1. [Model 4.](model_design_experimentation/005_011_model-experimentation-m4.md) A hierarchical model of multiple genes and cell lines with a varying intercept for each and a slope for each gene on RNA expression.
1. [Model 5.](model_design_experimentation/005_013_model-experimentation-m5.md) A multi-level hierarchical model with the main level consisting of two varying intercepts, one for the sgRNA and one for the cell line. The sgRNA varying intercept had an additional level where each guide came from a distribution for each gene.
1. [Model 6.](model_design_experimentation/005_015_model-experimentation-m6.md) A hierarchical model with varying effects for the intercept and slope pooling across sgRNA and gene. The slope is on synthetic copy number data.
1. [Model 7.](model_design_experimentation/005_017_model-experimentation-m7.md) A model with a single 2D varying intercept with one dimension for sgRNA and one for cell line. Then try to have the sgRNA dimension vary by gene. A model with two varying intercepts was also successfully fit in this notebook.

## [Model construction](model-construction/)

![reproducibility-limited](https://img.shields.io/badge/reproducibility-limited-orange.svg?style=flat)

1. [Experimenting with a simpler model.](model-construction/050_simplify-single-lineage-model.md) The model was simplified in order to move the project along.
1. [Introduce a chromosome-varying effect.](model-construction/055_chromosome-varying-effects.md) Introduction of another hierarchical layer in the cell line-effect variables to account for differential sensitivity of each chromosome of each cell line.

The following notebooks were analyses of running the model on the lineages prostate, liver, and colorectal.
These lineages were chosen because they represent examples of datasets of different sizes and complexities (e.g. number of cancer genes in the comutation matrix.)
The model of MCMC parameters were altered slightly from version to version.
(The posterior data for the models no longer exists, so these notebooks are retained primarily for reference.)
