## Basic checks

```python
FAILED_CHECKS = 0
```

Check that specific columns exist (prevents some really bonehead discoveries later on...).

```python
cols_that_should_exist = [
    "depmap_id",
    "sgrna",
    "hugo_symbol",
    "lfc",
    "screen",
    "num_mutations",

    "primary_or_metastasis",
]

missing_cols = [
    col for col in cols_that_should_exist if col not in depmap_modeling_df.columns
]
if len(missing_cols) != 0:
    print(f"Some columns ({len(missing_cols)}) that should be present are not ðŸ˜¦")
    print("  missing columns: " + ", ".join(missing_cols))
    FAILED_CHECKS += 1
```

Check that specific columns have no missing (`NA`) values.

```python
cols_without_na = [
    "depmap_id",
    "sgrna",
    "hugo_symbol",
    "lfc",
    "screen",
    "num_mutations",
    "is_mutated",
    "lineage",
]

na_checks = depmap_modeling_df.isna()[cols_without_na].any().compute()
num_missed_checks = na_checks.sum()

if num_missed_checks > 0:
    FAILED_CHECKS += num_missed_checks
    print(na_checks[na_checks])
```

```python
na_checks
```

    depmap_id        False
    sgrna            False
    hugo_symbol      False
    lfc              False
    screen           False
    num_mutations    False
    is_mutated       False
    lineage          False
    dtype: bool

Check that all combinations of cell line, sgRNA, and experimental replicate only appear once.

```python
grp_cols = ["depmap_id", "sgrna", "replicate_id"]
ct_df = (
    depmap_modeling_df.assign(n=1)[grp_cols + ["n"]]
    .groupby(grp_cols)
    .count()
    .query("n > 1")
    .compute()
)

if not ct_df.shape[0] == 0:
    print("There are some sgRNA with multiple targets.")
    print(ct_df.head(20))
    FAILED_CHECKS += 1
